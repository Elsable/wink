{"name":"Wink","tagline":"mobile javascript framework","body":"WINK\r\n\r\nWink Toolkit is a lightweight JavaScript toolkit which will help you build great \r\nmobile web apps. It is designed and developed to meet the specific constraints \r\nof the mobile environment.\r\n\r\nComponents\r\n----------\r\n\r\nView the index.html file to have an overview of the various components included in Wink.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the \"utils/build folder\", you will find utilities to optimize WINK.\r\nThe \"build_wink_core\" target of the \"build.xml\" file, will build\r\nthe core of the kit. It will create a \"wink\" folder in the \"utils/build\" directory\r\nand build the \"wink.min.js\" file (the concatenated and optimized core) that you should\r\nuse in your project.\r\n\r\nThe core is composed of:\r\n\r\n- _amd\r\n- _base/_kernel\r\n- _base/_base\r\n- _base/error\r\n- _base/json\r\n- _base/topics\r\n- _base/ua\r\n- _base/_feat\r\n- _base/_feat/featjson\r\n- _base/_feat/featcss\r\n- _base/_feat/featevent\r\n- _base/_feat/featdom\r\n- fx/_xy\r\n- net/xhr\r\n- math/_basics\r\n- ui/xy/layer\r\n- ux/touch\r\n- ux/event\r\n\r\nIf you want to build your own version of wink and add some more components,\r\nyou should first modify the \"profiles.json\" file to fit your needs and then just\r\nrun the default target of the build (\"called \"build_wink\")\r\n\r\nBuilder\r\n-------\r\n\r\nYou will also find a build utility in the utils/builder folder. It's a graphical web interface\r\nwhere you can pick and choose the modules you want to build. The builder will generate the minified JS\r\nand CSS files for you and give you the choice between downloading them as a ZIP file or \r\nretrieve them via a local address.\r\n\r\nThe builder generates a build url that you can also use to always work with a minifed version \r\nwhile under development.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe documentation can be generated from the source code using JSDoc. A specific\r\nwink template and configuration file are available in the utils/doc folder. Have\r\na look at the README file at the root of the utils/doc folder if you want to\r\ngenerate the documentation\r\n\r\n\r\nUtilities\r\n---------\r\n\r\nIn the \"utils\" folder, you will also find a utility to base64 encode images.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe WINK project is released under the \"Simplified BSD license\". See the \r\n\"licence.txt\" file for more details.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
